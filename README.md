A library allowing you to expose API endpoints using [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

You will be able to expose functions either using:

- a http endpoint per rpc
- a single http endpoint serving all calls
- websocket

## Dedication

The whole idea for this library was born after a long iteration period with dear friends.
It is heavily influenced by one of the best mentors of my (professional) life.
